Meeting w/Ashley

what would I have wanted as a manager

is there anything in this position that would keep me from being successful in that role?

Talk to employees to ask about the company.

I have experience - got through 3 stages.

“Good question! I was hoping to ask you the same thing. What’s the range for someone in this position at your company?”

“As long as it’s comparable to the market rate, I’ll be happy.” 

“According to Glassdoor and what my other peers are making for similar roles in this city, $x-$y seems like the market rate; does that sound right?”
