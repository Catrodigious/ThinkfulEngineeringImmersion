# Trees: Implementation and runtime

To succeed at this challenge, you'll need to demonstrate that you can do the following:

- Implement a binary search tree.

## Instructions

Your goal for this checkpoint is to get the tests to pass.

To do so, you will be modifying the existing BinarySearchTree class to implement a binary search tree with lookup, insert, and delete capabilities.

Existing files
<hr>

| File path  | Description |
| ---------- | ---------- |
|src/main.js | Contains some example uses of the BinarySearchTree class. |
| src/BinarySearchTree.js 	| Contains the definition of the BinarySearchTree class. The constructor() method has already been  completed for you. |


## Tasks

Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assignment.


In the src/BinarySeachTree.js file:

1. Complete the insert() method to insert a node into the BST. The method should accept a key and a value as its arguments.

2. Complete the find() method which should accept a key as its argument and return the value for the given key in the BST. Throw an Error() with a string error message if the node is not found in the BST.

3. Complete the remove() method to delete a node with a given key in the BST. Throw an Error() with a string error message if the node to be removed is not found in the BST.


Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
